Collision ==> {
Fine - SAT for boxes, creates mtv and minindex for creating contact points,  
Broad - either sphere or aabb, quickly finds potential collisions
}

Iterator ==> {
Rigidbody - Does physics steps every tick, here everything is combined to make the simulation run,
Cache - used by the stepper/iterator for storing impulses for next physics steps
}

Model_Placeholders

Physics Simulation ==> {
Physics Simulation - general variables for the physics sim, you can enable debug graphics here
}

Render ==> {
rigidbodies render - pretty obviously renders every rigidbody
}

Rigidbody ==> {
Joints - handles joint creation/deletion for rigidbodies and has general joint funcs
Rigidbody - handles rigidbody creation/deletion and has general rigidbody funcs
}

FidgetSetup - this combines every script nesseccary for one line init of the library

Greedy_Meshing - made by 4P5 modified a bit by me for a little bit more performance

Lines - made by umm SOOMUCHLAG used for debug graphics

Project Map - YOU ARE HERE

quaternions - small quaternion lib made by me
